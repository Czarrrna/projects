We will review your submitted project and come back with questions/concerns if we have any. The accepted projects will be found here: [projects](https://github.com/rails-girls-summer-of-code/projects-2015/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Aaccepted).


For Students: Are you interested in one of the projects? Have a look through these [projects](https://github.com/rails-girls-summer-of-code/projects-2015/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Aaccepted), which proposals where accepted by us.
