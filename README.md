# Rails Girls Summer of Code 2015
### Projects Proposals

Do you run an Open Source project? We would love to see you involved in Rails
Girls Summer of Code!

In order to propose a project for this year's Rails Girls Summer of Code please read our [Guide](LINK) first. We will review your submitted project and come back with questions/concerns if we have any. The accepted projects will be found here: [projects](https://github.com/rails-girls-summer-of-code/projects/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Aaccepted).


### Applying to work on a project 

Are you interested in one of the projects? Have a look through these [projects](https://github.com/rails-girls-summer-of-code/projects/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Aaccepted), which proposals where accepted by us. You can apply to them. Here is an [overview of all the submitted projects](https://github.com/rails-girls-summer-of-code/projects/issues). The ones which don't have the 'accepted' label are still being reviewed by us. 


Please contact the mentor who opened the issue. If an issue is locked, that means that the mentor is not taking on more applicants for his or her project. You can also find other Open Source projects, that are not yet proposed here and suggest to the mentor to submit his or her project here.
